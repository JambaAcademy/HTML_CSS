- `src/`: Contains all the source code files for the book’s hands-on projects and examples.
  - Code files are named in the format `program_chN_headingNM_X`, where:
    - `chN`: Represents the chapter number (e.g., `ch1` for Chapter 1, `ch2` for Chapter 2, etc.).
    - `headingNM`: Represents the section heading within the chapter (e.g., `heading1.1`, `heading1.2`, etc.).
    - `X`: Represents the program sequence within the section (e.g., `1`, `2`, `3`, etc.).
    - Example: `program_ch1_heading1.2_3.html` is the third program for Chapter 1, Section 1.2.
  - Files include HTML and CSS code for projects like building a portfolio, blog layout, or responsive navigation bar.
- `src/images/`: Contains all images, media, videos, and icons used in the book’s examples and projects.

## Getting Started

To make the most of this repository alongside the book, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/username/smarter-way-to-learn-html-css.git
   ```

2. **Set Up Your Environment**:

   - Ensure you have a code editor like Visual Studio Code, Sublime Text, or any browser-based editor (e.g., CodePen).
   - No additional software is required, as all code is written in standard HTML and CSS, viewable in any modern web browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Safari).
   - Optionally, install a local server (e.g., Live Server extension in VS Code) for a smoother development experience.

3. **Navigate the Code**:

   - Browse the `src/` folder to find code files corresponding to each chapter and section of the book.
   - Open any `.html` file in a browser to see the rendered webpage or edit the code to experiment with the examples.
   - Use the `src/images/` folder to access media assets referenced in the code.

4. **Follow Along with the Book**:

   - Each code file is designed to complement a specific section of the book. For example, `program_ch2_heading2.1_1.html` corresponds to the first example in Chapter 2, Section 2.1.
   - The book includes instructions for running and modifying these files to reinforce learning.

## Example Usage

Here’s how to use a sample code file from the repository:

1. **Open a Code File**:

   - Navigate to `src/program_ch1_heading1.1_1.html`.
   - This file demonstrates a basic HTML structure with inline CSS, as introduced in Chapter 1, Section 1.1.

2. **View the Output**:

   - Open the file in a web browser to see a simple webpage with a heading and styled paragraph.
   - Example code snippet:

     ```html
     <!DOCTYPE html>
     <html lang="en">
     <head>
         <meta charset="UTF-8">
         <title>My First Webpage</title>
         <style>
             body { font-family: Arial, sans-serif; }
             h1 { color: #2c3e50; }
         </style>
     </head>
     <body>
         <h1>Welcome to Web Development</h1>
         <p>This is my first webpage!</p>
     </body>
     </html>
     ```

3. **Experiment**:

   - Modify the CSS (e.g., change the `color` property) or add new HTML elements to see how they affect the output.
